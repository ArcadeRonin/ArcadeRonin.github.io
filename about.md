I’m **Ron Payne Jr**. Online I also go by **Retro Ron** (and **ArcadeRonin**).

By day, I work in **I.T. Desktop Support**. Handling problems face to face in the office and remotely with our stores. Troubleshooting, repairing, and keeping things running.  
Off-hours, I enjoy **retro games**, **retro tech**, and small projects that help me learn.

This site is my home base for write-ups, notes, and retro deep dives.
